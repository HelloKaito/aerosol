        Direct Broadcast Flat File Output File Format
       ----------------------------------------------

  The IMAPP MODIS flat file software reads in the MODIS
  L1B files and converts them to flat binary image format
  following the ENVI standard (.img and .hdr files). 

  These FORTRAN routines create binary flat files and header
  files in ENVI readable format from input L1B 1km, 500m, 250m,
  geolocation MODIS Direct Broadcast or DAAC formatted HDF files.
  The binary files can then be used as input for IMAPP MODIS
  direct broadcast Level 2 products.  The software will extract
  the data into either radiances or reflectances (normalized
  radiances - values not divided by the cosine of the solar
  zenith angle).

  The routines and how to execute them follow:

Routine Name                 Input         Platform    Output data
-----------                ----------      --------    -----------
modis_extract_1km.exe    L1b 1km hdf file  SatName  1km flat file and 
                                                       header file
modis_extract_met.exe    L1b 1km hdf file  SatName  Scan based meta file
                                                       and header file
modis_extract_hkm.exe    L1b 500m hdf file  SatName  500m flat file and
                                                       header file
modis_extract_qkm.exe    L1b 250m hdf file  SatName  250m flat file and 
                                                       header file
modis_extract_geo.exe    L1b geo. hdf file  SatName  Geolocation flat file
                                                       and header file

  Because the files are created following the ENVI header format,
  these files can be viewed and compared using ITT's ENVI tool
  (http://www.ittvis.com/envi/) or its free counterpart
  tool freelook, which can be downloaded from:

  The flatfile output products consist of separate .img files
  in flat binary format, and accompanying header file.
  
  modis_extract_1km.exe will create an output file with the  
  1000m.img  extension from the input L1B 1 km file (either
  a1*1000m.hdf or t1*1000m.hdf files) containing
  36 float band interleaved values at  1km pixel resolution. 
  Please see a list of these bands below. The test output file 
  that you create from the input test data set contains the nominal 
  MODIS swath size 1354 and 2890 lines.  Therefore, the product 
  a1.07066.2038.1000m.img file is 1354 elements, by 36 bands, 
  by 2890 lines. In FORTRAN and IDL, it would be read as an 
  array(1354,36,2890).  This would be reversed in C - 
  array(2890,36,1354).

  1 Kilometer - 1000m.img file format
----------------------------
  Four byte float data
  36 bands
  1km-pixel resolution

Where rad = Radiance units in Watts per square meter per
                          steradian per micron
      ref = reflectance - normalized radiance, not divided by the cosine
                          of the solar zenith angle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  modis_extract_hkm.exe will create an output file with the  
  500m.img extension from the input L1B 500 m file (either
  a1*500m.hdf or t1*500m.hdf files) containing
  7 float band interleaved values at 500 m pixel resolution. 
  Please see a list of these bands below. The test output file 
  that you create from the input test data set contains the nominal 
  MODIS swath size 2708 and 5780 lines.  Therefore, the product 
  a1.07066.2038.500m.img file is 2708 elements, by 7 bands, 
  by 5780 lines. In FORTRAN and IDL, it would be read as an 
  array(2708,7,5780).  This would be reversed in C - 
  array(5780,7,2708).  This file will be produced in daytime
  files only.

  Please see a list of these bands below. The test output file
  that you create from the input test data set contains the nominal
  MODIS swath size 5416 and 11560 lines.  Therefore, the product
  a1.07066.2038.250m.img file is 5416 elements, by 2 bands,
  by 11560 lines. In FORTRAN and IDL, it would be read as an
  array(5416,2,11560).  This would be reversed in C -
  array(11560,2,5416).  This file will be produced in daytime
  files only.

  by 2890 lines. In FORTRAN and IDL, it would be read as an
  array(1354,8,2890).  This would be reversed in C -
