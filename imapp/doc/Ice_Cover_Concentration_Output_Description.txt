    IMAPP MODIS Direct Broadcast Ice Mask
  and Ice Concentration Product Description
  -------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The IMAPP Ice Mask and Ice Concentration software produces retrievals 
  of the percentage of ice cover on water bodies within a 1 km
  MODIS pixel, as well as an Ice Mask that includes whether ice
  was found using wavelengths in the visible wavelength spectrum or 
  infrared wavelengths.  The output is at 1 km resolution.  The 
  inputs are the MODIS 1 km resolution L1B file, the MODIS Geolocation
  file and the and the MODIS 1 km Cloud Mask file. The software 
  was created by Yinhui Liu, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Space
  Science and Engineering Center, and integrated into
  IMAPP by Kathleen Strabala, kathy.strabala@ssec.wisc.edu.

  Output for this product is a flat binary file and an HDF4 file.

------------------
Binary Output File
------------------
  The software produces output files in binary format (.icecon.bin 
  extension) which consist of 4 bands of 4 byte data and no
  scaling at 1 km resolution.  The data is band sequential, meaning
  each band contains a complete swath of data prior to the beginning of the
  next band. The size of the file will depend upon the size of the 
  pass that is being processed (1354 x number_of_lines x 4 bands  x 4 bytes).

   Example file name:  t1.11110.0246.icecon.bin
   4 - 4 byte fields
   1). Latitude  4 byte float
   2). Longitude  4 byte float
   3). Ice Mask Long Integer (4 bytes)
        Values:
         -2: water, -1: land, 0: cloud over water, 1: visible technique 
         found ice, 2: infrared technique found ice, -999: missing
   4). Ice Concentration  4 byte float
         Values 0.-100. percent.  Missing values -999.

   Scale factor:  1.0
   1 km pixel resolution

------------------
HDF4 OUTPUT FILE
------------------
  The HDF4 output file (*icecon.hdf) contains 4 SDS arrays.  
  Latitude, Longitude at 5km resolution, Ice Mask at 1 km resolution
  and Ice Concentration in percent (%) at 1 km resolution.

  The Latitude and Longitude arrays are stored as 4 byte float values
  at 5 km resolution.

  The Ice_Mask SDS is stored as a long integer (4 byte) at 1 km.

  The Ice_Concentration is stored a 4 byte float value  at 1 km.
