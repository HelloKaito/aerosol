   IMAPP MODIS Direct Broadcast Sea Surface
        Temperature Product Description
  -------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The IMAPP SST software produces retrievals at 1 km
  resolution over all pixels.   If you wish to land
  or cloud clear the image, it is left to the user to do it for
  themselves.  It should be noted that this is not the algorithm
  used in the official DAAC MOD28 sst product.  

  For a description of the algorithm, please see:
  IMAPP MODIS Sea Surface Temperature Algorithm, Dr. James E. Davies,
  January 2004:
  ftp://ftp.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/IMAPP/MODIS/Level-2/v2.0/references/SST.pdf

  The user can choose the output format type, either HDF or
  binary.  If you are using the modis_level2.csh script,
  you set the OUTPUT_TYPE environmental variable in the 
  imapp_modisl2/env scripts to:

               1 = binary only 
               2 = hdf only 
               3 = binary and hdf 


Binary Output File
------------------
  The sea surface temperature output product consists of a separate
  .img file in flat binary format, and accompanying header file.

  The mod28.img file is a 12 float band interleaved product at 1 km 
  pixel resolution. Please see a list of these bands below.
  The test output file that you create from the input aqua test data 
  sets contains the nominal MODIS swath size 1354 elements and 
  2890 lines.  In FORTRAN, it would be read as sst(1354,12,2890).
  This would be reversed in C - sst(2890,12,1354).

HDF OUTPUT FILE
------------------
  The HDF output file (*mod28.hdf) contains 4 arrays.  Latitude, Longitude, the
  split-window 11-12 SST and the split window 4 micron SST output
  in units of degrees Celcius.  The two SST arrays are stored
  as short integers, and are scaled by a factor of .01.
