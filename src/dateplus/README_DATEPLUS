                    DATEPLUS INSTUCTIONS
                            May 2007
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    The dateplus.exe utility is used by the IMAPP MODIS Level
    2 software to convert dates from Julian to Gregorian and
    back.  It is used by all of the ancillary data fetching
    scripts and by some of the individual product scripts.

    This tool was developed by Bob Orlando.  For more information,
    please see his web site: http://www.orlandokuntao.com/dateplus_c.html

    Executing the binary dateplus.exe provides this help:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
    Program ID: dateplus.exe (07-14-2004 / v2.2)

      Usage: dateplus.exe -bHhJjSstuWwy
               [-|+]adj_days [yyyymmdd [iterations]]

                -b Basedate of today (or date specified)
                   since Jan. 1, 0001
                -H Detailed help (Documentation)
                -h Summary help (Usage)
                -J Julian (yyyyJJJ) to Gregorian (yyyymmdd)
                -j Julian day (ddd) for today or yyyymmdd
                -S Days since (or until) yyyymmdd (unsigned) 
                -s Days since (or until) yyyymmdd **
                -t Tomorrow's date
                -u Basedate of today (or date specified)
                   since Jan. 1, 1970--the Unix epoch date
                   (essentially 'dateplus -s 19700101')
                -W Date's long weekday
                -w Date's weekday
                   (-w or -W: see 'Exit Codes' below)
                -y Yesterday's date

      Notes: adj_days may be positive, negative, or unsigned.

             adj_days by itself (without a yyyymmdd option
             argument), yields an adjusted date that is
             calculated from today's date.  For example,
             'dateplus.exe 1' yields tomorrow's date).

             yyyymmdd is an optional date from which an
             adjusted date is calculated.

             iterations generate multiple dates that are
             adj_days apart (i.e. paydays).  This argument
             is not allowed with the julian (-j) option.

             yyyymmdd also may be a future date (useful for
             determining the number of days until a certain
             date).  Days future are reported negatively.
             For example, run on October 27, 1997), the
          ** 'dateplus -s 20000101' yielded -731, meaning
             731 days until Y2K.  (For unsigned results use
             -S option instead.)
