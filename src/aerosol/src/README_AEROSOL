            INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXECUTING THE IMAPP MODIS AEROSOL
              STANDALONE SOFTWARE FOR DIRECT BROADCAST
                            October 2011
             No changes were made to the software, since MODIS_L2_V2.1
                    only to this documentation.
    ----------------------------------------------------------
     This software should be executed by the main IMAPP MODIS
     Level 2 processing script (scripts/modis_level2.csh). The
     instructions for this are available in the top level IMAPP
     MODIS Level 2 README file.

     If you do not wish to use the automated script then
     this file describes the procedure to run the aerosol software 
     individual executable (aerosol.exe).  Please read the 
     top level MODIS Level 2 00README file which contains information
     about the entire MODIS Level 2 package prior to reading this 
     aerosol specific file. 
     --------------------------------------------------------

     This file contains instructions for creating the MODIS
     aerosol product, which consists of these 6 arrays at a 
     resolution of 10x10 1 km MODIS pixels for daytime only
     scenes.

         Latitude
         Longitude
         Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean - 
            AOT at 0.55 micron for both ocean (best) and land (corrected)
         Optical_Depth_Ratio_Small_Land_And_Ocean -
            Ratio of small mode optical depth at 0.55 micron
         Corrected_Optical_Depth_Land  (3 bands) - 
            Corrected optical thickness at 0.47, 0.55, and 0.66 micron
         Effective_Optical_Depth_Average_Ocean (7 bands) -
            AOT at seven bands for average solution at .47, .55, .66, 
            .86, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.1 micron

     A detailed description of the contents of the output files
     can be found in theAerosol_Output_Description.txt located within 
     the imapp_modisl2/doc directory.

     The product relies on the configuration file (aerosol/src/aerosol_only.cfg)
     for input and output file information. The file can be edited
     for each individual scene or can be used as part of an automated
     script (see modis_level2.csh in the imapp_modisl2/scripts directory).

Instructions for running the MODIS aerosol production software

Platform requirements:

   The MODIS aserosol software has been compiled and executed 
   successfully on the following platforms:

      The software has been compiled and executed successfully on the following
       Linux operating systems using the g77 gnu (gcc 3.2.1) compiler:

      Red Hat Linux x86 7.2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 x86_64
         and Linux CentOS 4.2 x86_64 on Sun Operton platforms

Ancillary data requirements:
      This distribution contains all ancillary data required to successfully
      run the pre-configured test.  However, for processing real time MODIS
      direct broadcast data, you will want to use real time files
      (data descriptions below) which can be fetched from:

      ftp://ftp.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/eosdb/ancillary/

      This site contains the entire record of ancillary data files
      covering the lifetimes of the Aqua and Terra missions.

      The aerosol processing software uses the global data assimilation 
      system (gdas) analysis GRIB files, or the forecast GFS files (gfs) 
      and either the TOVS global ozone GRIB file (yymmdd.grb) or TOAST 
      global ozone GRIB file (TOAST16_yymmdd.GRB) as inputs.
      For more information on ancillary data, please see the 
      ftp://ftp.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/eosdb/ancillary/00README_ANCILLARY.txt
      file.

Software Requirements:

   (1) The ancillary data can be automatically identified and
       transferred by using the ancillary scripts located within
       the /imapp_modisl2/scripts directory. These scripts require 
       the LOCAL_ANC_DIR (the local ancillary directory that you 
       want the data to be downloaded to) and the REMOTE_ANC_DIR 
       (the remote FTP ancillary data directory that you wish to 
       download data from) environmental variables to be set 
       prior to execution.  These scripts use the ncftpget utility 
       to fetch the data.  One version of ncftpget that has been 
       tested on the supported platforms is included in the 
       /imapp_modisl2/bin directory.  
       
       The scripts used are:
          Fetch the matching GDAS or GFS GRIB forecast files to the MODIS
          input L1B time.
           get_anc_gdas_gfs.csh date time
                  where
              date is the required date (yyyyddd)
              time is the required time (hhmm)
        
          Fetch the closest Toast Ozone GRIB file
           get_anc_toast_ozone.csh date
                  where
              date is the required date (yyyyddd)

          Or if the date is prior to 1 April 2005,
          fetch the closest TOVS Ozone GRIB file
           get_anc_tovs_ozone.csh date date (yyyyddd)
                  where
              date is the required date (yyyyddd)

       Once you have the gdas/gfs and ozone files locally, you need
       to extract the native GRIB file into binary 
       fields. These extraction .csh scripts are located within the 
       /imapp_modisl2/bin directory.  The wgrib utility
       performs the extraction of the GRIB files and is called from 
       within these scripts:

            extract_ncep_gdas1.csh gdas1file outputfilename

                      and

            extract_tovs_ozone.csh ozone_file outfile
            
                where ozone_file is either the tovs or toast grib file   

       A version of wgrib that has been statically linked and tested on the
       supported platforms in located in the /imapp_modisl2/bin directory.
       
   (2) The L1B data must be extracted into binary .img and .hdr
       files.  These binary files are used as input to the aerosol
       software.

       This is done through executing the flatfile software, whose
       binary executables are located within the /imapp_modisl2/bin
       directory.

       The flatfile software is executed as follows:

Routine Name                 Input         Platform    Output data
-----------                ----------      --------    -----------
modis_extract_1km.exe    L1b 1km hdf file  SatName  1km flat file and header
                                                         file
modis_extract_met.exe    L1b 1km hdf file  SatName  Scan based meta file and
                                                         header file
modis_extract_hkm.exe    L1b 500m hdf file  SatName  500m flat file and header
                                                         file
modis_extract_qkm.exe    L1b 250m hdf file  SatName  250m flat file and header
                                                         file
modis_extract_geo.exe    L1b geo. hdf file  SatName  Geolocation flat file and
                                                         header file

   (3) The cloud mask binary (.img) and header files (.hdr) need 
       to be available.  These are created using the cloudmask
       executable and setting the output file type to 1 or 3.
       Please see the README_CLOUDMASK file located within the 
       /imapp_modisl2/src/cloudmask directory.  The binary and
       header files (<prefix>.mod35.img, <prefix>.mod35qa.img,
       <prefix>.mod35.hdr and <prefix>.mod35qa.hdr) are used as 
       input to the aerosol software.


Installation:
   (1) Download the full IMAPP Level 2 package from:

        http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/imapp/

       and upack the tar file as descibed in the README file
       that accompanies the software release.


   (2) Build the executables, if you choose to.  Statically linked
       binary executables tested on the supported platforms are located 
       within the imapp_modisl2/bin directory.  A make file for the
       aerosol software is located in the /imapp_modisl2/src/aerosol/src
       directory.  It will attempt to use standard compilers for
       detected platforms to build the executables.  To use this
       make file, within the imapp_modisl2/src/aerosol/src directory,
       type make.  This will attempt to build the executable, aerosol.exe,
       in the same directory.

       To build other executables, please see the README files that
       are located with each inidividual software unit located in the
       imapp_modisl2/src directory.
       
Run:

   (1) Again, you will need to have the ancillary data extracted into
       binary form, the L1B files extracted into binary form, and the
       cloudmask binary files ready as input.  For more information,
       please see the software requirements section above.

       Once these binary files are ready, fill out the input/output
       information including the full data paths, in the aerosol_only.cfg 
       file located within the imapp_modisl2/src/aerosol/src directory.  
       There is another configuration file that exists in the 
       imapp_modisl2/config directory (aerosol.cfg) that is used with the 
       automated processing script run_modis_aerosol.csh which is
       called by modis_level2.csh.  The aerosol.cfg script has pre-set
       placeholders which are dynamically filled during run time.
       This script will not work as an input file to aerosol.exe
       in this standalone execution.  You should fill in the 
       input and output file information in the aerosol_only.cfg file.

       The static coefficient file names are set in the aerosol_only.cfg
       file.  These files are located in the aerosol/coefficients
       directory and statically linked into the imapp_modisl2/coeff
       directory.  You should set the path to these coefficient
       files in the aerosol_only.cfg file.

       The coefficient files are:

         aerosol_land_map.v2
         big_v1c1.dat.v2
         big_v2c1.dat.v5
         big_v3c1.dat.v2
         lookup_land_w0466.v1
         lookup_land_w0553.v1
         lookup_land_w0644.v1
         lookup_land_w2119.v1
         mod04ocean.in.v1
         small_v1c1.dat.v2
         small_v2c1.dat.v3
         small_v3c1.dat.v2
      
   
   (2) To use the preconfigured test Terra data set, follow the 
       instructions in the main top level 00README file
       to unpack the test input and output data sets. You may
       choose to unpack them into the imapp_modisl2/input_data
       directory.  This will unpack all of the required input 
       files needed to create the MODIS level2 IMAPP aerosol
       products:

          t1.11302.1935.1000m.hdf    -  Terra MODIS 1km L1B input file
          t1.11302.1935.250m.hdf     -  Terra MODIS 250m L1B input file
          t1.11302.1935.500m.hdf     -  Terra MODIS 500m L1B input file
          t1.11302.1935.geo.hdf      -  Terra MODIS 1km geolocation file
          gdas1.PGrbF00.111029.18z   -  Global model analysis grib file 
          TOAST16_111029.GRB         -  Total ozone global grib file

       Follow the instructions to run the flatfile extractors, the
       ancillary data extractors and the cloud mask to get the 
       inputs needed for the aerosol production software.  You must 
       then modify the aerosol_only.cfg file to point to these inputs.  
       To use the test data set, you will need to extract these 
       files into binary and header files:

       t1.11302.1935.1000m.hdr
          MODIS extracted Level 1B 1km header file 
       t1.11302.1935.1000m.img
          MODIS extracted Level 1B 1km binary image file 
       t1.11302.1935.250m.hdr
          MODIS extracted Level 1B 250m header file
       t1.11302.1935.250m.img
          MODIS extracted Level 1B 250m binary image file
       t1.11302.1935.500m.hdr
          MODIS extracted Level 1B 500m header file 
       t1.11302.1935.500m.img
          MODIS extracted Level 1B 500m binary image file
       t1.11302.1935.geo.hdr
          MODIS extracted geolocation header file
       t1.11302.1935.geo.img
          MODIS extracted geolocation binary image file
       t1.11302.1935.met.hdr 
          MODIS extracted Level 1B met header file
       t1.11302.1935.met.img
          MODIS extracted Level 1B met binary image file (scan type and mirror side info)
       gdas1.PGrbF00..bin
          Global model analysis binary grid fields extracted from grib file 
       TOAST16_111029.GRB.bin  
          Total ozone binary grid field extracted from grib file
       t1.11302.1935.mod35.hdr     - Cloud mask header file
       t1.11302.1935.mod35.img     - Cloud mask binary image file
       t1.11302.1935.mod35qa.hdr   - Cloud mask QA header file
       t1.11302.1935.mod35qa.img   - Cloud mask QA binary image file

   (3) Once you have modified the aerosol_only.cfg file you are
       ready to run the software.  Make sure you have set the correct
       file and path names, including paths to the coefficient files.
       Create a run directory at the same 
       level as aerosol/src, i.e., imapp_modisl2/src/aerosol/run and                   copy the aerosol.exe and the aerosol_only.cfg file into it.
       The following shows how to execute the aerosol retrieval software:

            Usage: aerosol.exe cfgname sat_name month
              where
            cfgname: name of the aserosol configuration file
            sat_name: MODIS satellite platform name (Aqua or Terra)
            month: numeric month (1-12) of dataset

       For the test data set example you would type:

             aerosol.exe aerosol_only.cfg Terra 10

       The executable run using the input Terra test files will produce 
       output files with the names and locations indicated in the
       aerosol_only.cfg file.  For instance, the test output data
       sets have these names:

       t1.11302.1935.mod04.hdr     - Atmospheric aerosol header file
       t1.11302.1935.mod04.img     - Atmospheric aerosol image file
       t1.11302.1935.mod04debug.txt- Aerosol nadir statistics file

Output file descriptions:
       
       See the Aerosol_Output_Description.txt file located within
       the imapp_modisl2/doc directory.  The .hdr files will also 
       contain output file format information.

Verifying the aerosol direct broadcast product output.

       The aerosol package includes both sample MOD04 HDF
       output files along with an executable used to create it from the
       mod04.img files (create_fake_mod04.exe).  There is a statcially 
       compiled binary for the supported platforms located in the 
       MODIS_L2_HOME/bin directory

       To use the create_fake_mod04.exe software, the 1000m hdf
       file will be used as an input to get lat/lon array values.

        Usage: create_fake_mod04.exe <mod021km> <img file> <hdf file>
          where <mod021km> - modis 1km L1B file
          where <img file> - t1.11302.1935.img file for the mod04 image file
          where <hdf file> - output hdf file

       To use with the test data sets as an example, 
       you would type:

       create_fake_mod04.exe t1.11302.1935.1000m.hdf t1.11302.1935.mod04.img t1.11302.1935.mod04.hdf

       Please note that the output hdf file is not intended to be
       a reproduction of the official MOD04 aerosol HDF file. It is
       nothing more than a file that contains enough information
       for a viewer to display the data.  It also includes enough
       information for the files to be compared using the 
       HDF utility hdiff.  One statically compiled version for linux 
       platforms is located in the imapp_modisl2/bin directory.

       To use hdiff to compare files, you could use this command where 
       the first file is the output file you just created, and the
       second file is the benchmark file that you unpacked from the 
       test input and output data file that accompanies this release:      

        hdiff -b -S  t1.11302.1935.mod04.hdf  ../benchmark/t1.11302.1935.mod04.hdf
